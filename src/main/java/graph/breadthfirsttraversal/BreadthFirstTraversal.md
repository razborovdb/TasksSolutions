## Description
Perform a breadth-first traversal on the given graph described by adj_list. The traversal should start at the node given by start.

The graph is presented as an adjacency list. The ith row contains an array of all the node indexes that node i is connected to.

When performing the BFT, if a node has multiple neighbors, enqueue those neighbors on the queue in the order they appear in adj_list.
