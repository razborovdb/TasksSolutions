## Description
Perform a level-first (breadth-first) traversal of the given binary tree.

The output should be an integer array consisting of all the node values in level-first traversal order.

When enqueueing, enqueue the left, then enqueue the right.

For the queue implementation, you can make your own with a linked list, or you can use something built-in as a queue, even if it has poor time complexity.
